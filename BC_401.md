## UNIT 1: Introduction to OOP

Some points: 

	1. A class can have a most one constructor and at most one static constructor. Does it mean that the constructor in ABAP can't b overloaded? --> Inheritance will be mentioned later.
	2. There are two types of methods that are called implicitly: 
        a. Constructer is called by 'CREATE OBJECT'; 
        b. What is the second one? 
	3. In class definition, we can have some methods implemented?
	4. Do the constructor must be public?

## Unit 2: Concept and Programming Techniques

### Lesson 1: Inheritance and Casting

Constructor

	- It's mandatory to call immediate superclass's constructor when implementing a subclass's constructor. (Here, the concept of overloading is of relevance. But overloading is not supported in ABAP Objects.)

	- The static constructor is called automatically.

	- In java, we say that a constructor can't be static. A subclass can't override a static method. 

CAST 



Question:
=========
	1. A subclass can always have a static constructor - whether the superclass has a static constructor or not. …. In this case, is there a superclass static constructor being called??? 


### Lesson 2: Interfaces and Casting

### Lesson 3: Events
	- Components: attributes, methods, events.
	- Runtime system rather the client will call the handler method.
	- Events only have export parameters which must be passed by value.
	

Question:
========  
	- Not very clear about register the handler method, check it again

## Unit 3: Object-Oriented Repository Objects

### Lesson 1: Global Classes and Interfaces
Target: Use Class Builder; implement BAdI technology

TYPES defines local data type. CLASS defines local object type. 
Global classes and interfaces are individual Repository objects.

__Totally lost, Exercise 15-19 remain.__

### Lesson 2: Special Object-Oriented Programming Techniques
Keywords: final, abstract

> Access to Internal Tables with Object References

__Not sure the use of declaring READ-ONLY.__

> Navigation method & chaining of methods

	- Navigation method: be used to navigate from one object to another, commonly used when Association between classes are  involved.
	- Chaining of methods: call a method of a reference which is retrieved by navigation method. 

> Visibility of Constructor

1. Private: Factor-Methods; 
2. Protected; 
3. Public.

        Syntax:
            CLASS lcl_xxx DEFINITION CREATE PUBLIC.
            …
            ENDCLASS.
The visibility is not determined by which section the constructor is placed.

> Factor Method

> Singleton Concept

Here, we will use GET_INSTANCE to get/create the only one instance,  GET_INSTANCE is a functional method. (GET_INSTANCE should be a class-method).

__Not sure about functional method.__

> Friendship Relationship Between Classes

Usage: 
1. Instantiation regardless of the constructor visibility; 
2. Direct access to private attributes.

Attention: Granting friendship is one-sided.

> Factor Class as Application Example for Friendship

A factor class creates and administrates the instances of a class.

Question:
====
Exercise 20.
Task 3: Why need to inhibit inheritance from LCL_TRAVEL_AGENCY?

Exercise 21 unfinished.

====================================================

### Lesson 3: Persistent Objects and OO-Transactions
Use ABAPA objects to store instances of global classes in DB tables, permanently and independently of global programs.

Data and objects exist along with a program, so we need to store them in DB.

> Persistent Objects as Instances of Special Global Classes

	- "persistent class" indicates the instances of the class ar managed by the Persistence Service.
	- Every instance should contain key attributes, like object GUID, to ensure they are unique.
	- Instances  of persistent classes, i.e., persistent objects.
	- The class actor is a singleton instance and has a friendship with the persistent class. Methods in the class can be accessed and redefined by the actor.


Question: 
========
	1. Not very clear about the difference between objects and data.

## Unit 4: Exception Handling and RTTS 
### Lesson 1: Exception Handling in ABAP objects
Target: 
- Create exception class
- Raise, Propagate, Handle, and Map class-based exception.

> Raise & Handle    

__Raising__ an exception means instantiating an exception class instance.
__Handling__ means getting access to  the exception object and evaluating its attribute values.
	
- Raise: by the RAISE EXCEPTION statement or by the runtime environment
- Caught and Handled:  with the TRY…CATCH…ENDTRY structure. 

> Properties of Exception Class

- Many predefined exception class
- Create global exception class in Class Builder, local exception class within  a program or a global class.
- Prefix: "CX_" for global exception class, "lcx_" for local exception class.
- CX_ROOT: inherited by CX_NO_CHECK, CX_STATIC_CHECK, CX_DYNAMIC_CHCEK, which are different at hoe they are treated by the syntax check and the runtime environment.

> Handling of Class-based Exceptions

CLEANUP Block is executed when the TRY-ENDTRY structure exits because the system can't find a handler within the TRY-ENDTRY structure itself but in a surrounding TRY-ENDTRY or in a calling program. (don't understand)
 
> Analyzing the Exception Object  

Analyze by calling some functional methods.

> Defining Global Exception Classes

Skipped.
=======

> Raising Class-based Exception

- Raise via creating exception object (RAISE EXCEPTION TYPE cx_xxx) or using the existing exception object
- Setting the exception text via constructor parameter 'TEXTID'

> Propagating Class-based Exception

If the called method raises an exception, the calling method must CATCH/handle it or RAISING/propagate it.

Question: 
======
how do we check if a method has raised an exception? Check source code?

> Exception Classes: The Inheritance Hierarchy 

The choice of the superclass has an influence on the way a given exception is handled by the syntax check and by the runtime environment.

- CX_STATIC_CHECK: syntax check warning if an exception is neither handled or propagated. Default superclass when defining new global exception classes.
- CX_DYNAMIC_CHCEK: runtime error if an exception is raised at runtime and is neither handled or propagated. Cx_sy_xxx are the typical example.
- CX_NO_CHECK: be handled or be propagated automatically till an runtime error occurs.

> Exception Handling in Detail  

- Retry After an Exception -- 'RETRY'
-- how to make sure that the cause of the error must can be removed? If not this case, then endless loop still occurs.
- Resumable Exceptions -- 'CATCH BEFORE UNWIND'
	- With RESUME statement, we can resume a program immediately after the statement that raised the exception
	- Keep the context of the exception using 'CATCH BEFORE UNWIND'.
- Re-Raising Exceptions
	- Do some handling and continue to passing it.
	- Difference between re-raise and propagate: propagate doesn't contain a CATCH block at all while re-raise does handle the exception to some extent.
 
> Mapping Exception to Each Other

During mapping, a new type exception instance is created with PREVIOUS parameter is set as the caught exception.

Exercise 22 & 23 need to create global class, don't know how… Skipped.
=======

### Lesson 2: RTTS ( Run Time Type Service)
Target: 
- Query Type attributes at runt time
- Create types dynamically
RTTS = RTTI (identification) + RTTC (creation)

> Type Analysis at Runtime 

    Type => data, object
        Data => element, reference, complex
            Complex => structure, (internal) table
        Object => class, interface

> Dynamic Data Type Analysis & Dynamic Object Type Analysis 

- Dynamic Data Type Analysis: describe_by_data( data_name) // In the given example, the data is an internal table.
- Dynamic Object Type Analysis: dsescribe_by_object_ref( object_ref_name )

The given example demonstrates the reference SENDER of the handler method IN_VEHICLE_CREATED for the class LCL_RENTAL.

> Type Analysis at Runtime

A reference variable from the static type of the xxxDESC class that refers to a type object is specified for the HANDLE.

> Summary for RTTS:

- In exercise 24, we avoid downcast runtime error by checking lo_plane type before we execute downcast.
